## Basic Components

### 1. **Neurons (Nodes)**
- The basic building blocks
- Receive inputs, process them, and produce an output
- Similar to biological neurons in your brain

### 2. **Layers**
- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Process the information (can be one or many)
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction

### 3. **Weights and Biases**
- **Weights**: Determine the strength of connections between neurons
- **Biases**: Allow shifting the activation function left/right
- These are the parameters that get "learned" during training

### 4. **Activation Functions**
- Introduce non-linearity into the network
- Common examples: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
- Decide whether a neuron should "fire" or not

## How it Works (High Level)

1. **Forward Propagation**: 
   - Data flows from input → hidden layers → output
   - Each connection has a weight, each neuron applies an activation function

2. **Loss Calculation**: 
   - Compare predictions with actual values
   - Measure how "wrong" the network is

3. **Backpropagation**: 
   - Calculate how much each weight contributed to the error
   - Adjust weights to reduce error

4. **Training**: 
   - Repeat the process many times to improve accuracy
